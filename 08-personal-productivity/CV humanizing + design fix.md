# Humanize and Finalize the Attached Tailored CV and Cover Letter

## Role

Act as a senior CV and cover-letter editor specializing in technical job applications, ATS-safe wording, factual preservation, and document-quality control.

Use the `/humanizer` skill if it is available in the current environment. Treat it only as a wording/style aid: every factual, tailoring, formatting, and document-preservation rule below overrides any conflicting behavior from that skill. If `/humanizer` is unavailable, perform the same humanization pass directly rather than stopping.

## Objective

Revise the attached tailored CV and cover letter so they read naturally, credibly, and professionally, as if written carefully by the candidate rather than generated from a generic application template.

This is an execution task. Edit the complete attached documents and return the finished files. Do not provide only recommendations, excerpts, or rewritten text in chat.

The revisions must improve wording without changing:

- underlying facts;
- meaning;
- candidate positioning;
- role-specific tailoring;
- technical precision;
- document structure;
- visual design;
- page count wherever technically possible.

## Source Priority

Use the following sources in this order:

1. the attached tailored CV;
2. the attached tailored cover letter;
3. `CV_Design_Spec.md`, if available in the project or supplied context;
4. other CV/cover-letter rebuild or source files available in the same project;
5. the target-vacancy material already supplied or available in the project context.

Do not invent information that is missing from these sources.

If the exact target vacancy is unavailable, preserve the existing job-specific terminology and tailoring rather than guessing additional keywords or company facts.

## Required Workflow

### 1. Inspect Before Editing

Read both complete documents and any available design/rebuild files before changing anything.

Identify:

- factual statements that must remain unchanged;
- technical terminology, products, tools, frameworks, methodologies, and keywords that must be preserved;
- wording that genuinely sounds unnatural, generic, repetitive, inflated, overly polished, or machine-generated;
- existing page structure and visual constraints.

Do not rewrite sentences merely for the sake of making changes.

### 2. Revise the CV

Edit only wording that materially benefits from improvement.

Pay particular attention to:

- professional summary;
- project descriptions;
- work-experience bullets;
- descriptions of responsibilities and contributions;
- repeated verbs and sentence patterns;
- awkward or forced vacancy-keyword insertion;
- vague corporate wording;
- statements whose wording sounds stronger than the available evidence supports.

CV bullets should remain:

- concise;
- specific;
- factual;
- natural;
- technically precise;
- ATS-compatible;
- tailored to the target vacancy.

Preserve established technical terminology, programming languages, frameworks, tools, products, methodologies, certifications, and other proper names exactly where appropriate.

Do not remove an important vacancy keyword merely to make a sentence sound more conversational. Rewrite around it naturally where necessary.

### 3. Revise the Cover Letter

Make the letter read as one coherent and personal explanation of:

- why the candidate is applying;
- why this specific role and company are relevant;
- how the candidate's actual background connects to the position;
- what the candidate can realistically contribute;
- what the candidate hopes to learn where already supported;
- any stated availability or scheduling information.

Improve:

- transitions;
- sentence rhythm and variety;
- overly formulaic openings or conclusions;
- repetitive structures;
- generic corporate language;
- awkward keyword insertion.

Do not introduce new:

- personal motivations;
- company facts;
- experiences;
- achievements;
- technical expertise;
- claims about culture or values;
- career goals;

unless already supported by the supplied materials.

The finished letter should sound thoughtful and specific without becoming informal.

## Non-Negotiable Factual Constraints

Do not invent, infer, embellish, upgrade, or add any:

- experience;
- skill;
- achievement;
- responsibility;
- project contribution;
- metric;
- certification;
- education detail;
- employment detail;
- language proficiency;
- technical proficiency;
- availability information;
- personal information.

Do not turn exposure into proficiency, coursework into professional experience, participation into ownership, or unmeasured work into quantified achievements.

If existing wording appears potentially unsupported, weaken only the wording necessary to match the available evidence while preserving the intended positioning.

## Language Rules

Use professional, natural English.

Avoid:

- robotic phrasing;
- generic application language;
- unnecessary formality;
- exaggerated confidence;
- excessive adjectives;
- repetitive sentence openings;
- long multi-clause sentences where simpler wording is clearer;
- unnecessary em dashes;
- artificial informality;
- obvious keyword stuffing.

Avoid unsupported clichés such as:

- "passionate professional";
- "results-driven individual";
- "perfect fit";
- "dynamic environment";
- "unique opportunity";
- "I am confident that I would be an asset."

Prefer plain, precise wording over polished-sounding filler.

## ATS and Vacancy-Tailoring Constraints

Preserve all relevant existing job-specific keywords when they accurately describe the candidate.

Do not:

- weaken technical specificity;
- replace precise technical terms with vague alternatives;
- remove keywords simply to make prose sound less optimized;
- add unsupported keywords from the vacancy.

Natural phrasing and ATS compatibility must both be maintained.

## Document and Design Lock

Do not redesign either document.

Preserve, as closely as the source format technically allows:

- fonts;
- font sizes;
- colours;
- margins;
- spacing;
- alignment;
- indentation;
- bullets;
- section order;
- section names;
- rules and separators;
- header structure;
- page dimensions;
- page structure;
- page count.

Do not add, remove, rename, merge, split, or reorder sections unless correcting an unmistakable source-file error requires it.

Use `CV_Design_Spec.md` and available rebuild/source files as authoritative references for layout reconstruction when necessary.

If wording changes create overflow, solve it first through small wording reductions or equivalent line-length adjustments. Do not solve text overflow by redesigning the document, shrinking fonts, reducing margins, compressing spacing, or changing the established layout unless the existing source files already specify that behavior.

If exact preservation is technically impossible in the supplied file format, preserve the design as faithfully as possible and clearly identify the unavoidable limitation rather than silently redesigning the document.

## Clarification Rule

Ask a question before editing only if an unresolved ambiguity could materially change:

- factual accuracy;
- intended meaning;
- candidate positioning;
- document selection;
- or the correct interpretation of the source material.

Do not ask about minor stylistic preferences that can be resolved conservatively from the supplied documents.

Do not ask for information already available in the attached files, project context, or conversation.

## Final Quality-Control Pass

Before returning the files, compare the revised documents with the originals and verify all of the following:

### Factual integrity

- No factual information changed unintentionally.
- No unsupported claims were introduced.
- No experience or proficiency was strengthened beyond the evidence.
- Dates, names, technologies, certifications, education, availability, and other factual details remain accurate.

### Tailoring and ATS integrity

- Important role-specific keywords remain.
- Technical terminology remains precise.
- Tailoring to the target vacancy has not been weakened.
- No new unsupported vacancy requirements have been claimed.

### Writing quality

- The wording sounds natural when read aloud.
- Generic AI-style language has been removed where present.
- Sentence structures are varied but straightforward.
- The CV remains concise.
- The cover letter reads coherently as a single application rather than a collection of tailored phrases.
- Tone is consistent across both documents.

### Document integrity

- Visual design has not been intentionally changed.
- Section order and structure remain intact.
- Fonts, colours, margins, spacing, alignment, and other layout properties remain consistent with the source/design specification.
- Original page count is preserved wherever technically possible.
- No clipping, overflow, broken characters, malformed bullets, or accidental layout shifts remain.

## Final Output

Apply the edits directly to both complete documents.

Return:

1. the finalized CV in the same file format as the original;
2. the finalized cover letter in the same file format as the original.

Do not return only suggested edits, excerpts, or replacement text.

The files should be submission-ready without requiring another rewriting pass.
